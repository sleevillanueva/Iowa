#Liquor Sales + Linear Regression

Scenario: I am a data scientist in residence at the Iowa State tax board. The Iowa State legislature is considering changes in the liquor tax rates and wants a report of current liquor sales by county and projections for the rest of the year.

I used Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, LassoCV and GridSearchCV from sklearn. To know more what I did in detail, refer to the project file in the assets folder.
